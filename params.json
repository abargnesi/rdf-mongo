{"name":"Rdf-mongo","tagline":"RDF.rb storage adapter for MongoDB","body":"# rdf-mongo :: MongoDB storage adapter for RDF.rb\r\n\r\nThis is an [RDF.rb][] storage adapter for MongoDB.\r\n\r\nSee <http://blog.datagraph.org/2010/04/rdf-repository-howto> for an overview of the general approach of creating RDF::Repository adaptors.\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rdf-mongo.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/rdf-mongo)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ruby-rdf/rdf-mongo.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ruby-rdf/rdf-mongo)\r\n\r\n## Versioning and backwards compatibility\r\n\r\nMoving forward, the versioning will reflect the [RDF.rb][] version number for which all rdf-specs are passing.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that prior to 1.0, there are no guarantees of backwards compatibility for data stored using previous versions of the gem.  This is to make optimizing the schema for MongoDB easy.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou'll need the 'mongo', 'rdf', 'rdf-spec', and 'rspec' libraries.  The easiest way to install these is via RubyGems.\r\n\r\n    $ sudo gem install mongo rdf rdf-spec rspec rdf-mongo\r\n\r\n## Implementation Notes\r\n\r\nRDF Statements are stored as individual documents within MONGO using the following BSON:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"s\":  RDF::Value\r\n      \"st\": one of :u or :n\r\n      \"p\":  RDF::URI\r\n      \"pt\": must be :n\r\n      \"o\"   RDF::Value\r\n      \"ot\"  one of :u, :n, :l, :ll, or :lt\r\n      \"ol\"  Language symbol or RDF::URI\r\n      \"c\"   RDF::Value or false\r\n      \"ct\": one of :u, :n, :l, :ll, :lt or :default\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAn alternative that may be examined at a later point would be to use a representation based on RDF/JSON,\r\nor JSON-LD. This would save documents based on a common subject with \r\none more more predicates having one or more types.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nPlease post questions or feedback to the [W3C-ruby-rdf mailing list][].\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n * [Pius Uzamere][] | <http://github.com/pius> | <http://pius.me>\r\n * [Gregg Kellogg][] | <http://github.com/gkellogg> | <http://greggkellogg.net>\r\n\r\n### Thank you\r\n\r\n* Ben Lavender (author of the adapter skeleton) | <blavender@gmail.com> | <http://github.com/bhuga> | <http://bhuga.net> | <http://blog.datagraph.org>\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nThis repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.\r\n\r\n* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.\r\n* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.\r\n* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the\r\n  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.\r\n* Don't touch the `.gemspec`, `VERSION` or `AUTHORS` files. If you need to\r\n  change them, do so on your private branch only.\r\n* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding\r\n  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.\r\n* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule\r\n  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an\r\n  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\n[W3C-ruby-rdf mailing list]:        http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/\r\n[Pius Uzamere]: http://pius.me\r\n[Gregg Kellogg]: http://greggkellogg.net/me\r\n[RDF.rb]:           http://rdf.rubyforge.org/\r\n[YARD]:             http://yardoc.org/\r\n[YARD-GS]:          http://rubydoc.info/docs/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md\r\n[PDD]:              http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/2010May/0013.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
